## Automated Security Updates (Dependabot)

Dependabot monitors:
- npm/yarn packages  
- GitHub security advisories  
- Vulnerable dependency chains downstream  

When a vulnerability is detected, Dependabot will automatically submit a PR with the required update.  
Critical dependencies are checked daily.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- GitHub **Private Security Advisory**, or  
- Email: **security@yourdomain.com**

Please include:
- Steps to reproduce  
- Expected vs actual behavior  
- Any logs or screenshots  

You will receive an acknowledgment within **48 hours**, and a response or patch within **7 days**.
